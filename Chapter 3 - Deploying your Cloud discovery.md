1. Consuming cloud resources vs building cloud resources.
    * Find me 3 services that would be considered consuming services for a business
    * Find me 3 services that are completely built and managed which would include the data centers, equipment and all associated costs.
2. Find me 3 cloud services that would let me manage application workflow that contain a Kanban capability.
    * Which of these is the most popular across the industry.
3. Under what circumstances would a company use a hybrid cloud model?
4. Choose 1 of the 3 main cloud providers.
       * Design me a network diagram that will have:
       * Public network with a load balancer which can be routed to the Internet
       * Private network with 2 virtual machine instances to run the web service
       * A database server that can only be accessed by the private network
Your diagram should use the cloud providers icons in the diagram to represent the components, and a key to let us know what they are.
5. Based on your chosen cloud provider in 4, how can you ensure that your infrastructure will be resilient to failure?
